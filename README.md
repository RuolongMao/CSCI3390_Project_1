## Bitcoin mining with Spark
The key to mining Bitcoin is to solve a puzzle involving the SHA-256 hash function, where SHA stands for "security hash algorithm" and 256 denotes the output of the hash function as having 256 bits (or, equivalently, a 64-digit hexadecimal number). Given a Bitcoin header string `S`, the puzzle is to find a positive integer `x` (called "nonce") such that the concatenation `xS` is hashed to a hexadecimal number with `k` leading zeros. The parameter `k` is known as the difficulty of the puzzle. The actual Bitcoin difficulty is currently 11. [Here](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html) is a working exhibit of an SHA-256 calculator.  

Let's look at an example of the mining process to clarify. Say we hash the string `this_is_a_bitcoin_block` with the SHA-256 function, which produces `5de97c4b0b4fd55c033fb1de4723de24b8fea9c6caa09af43008e0412ee2847a`. Now, we set the nonce to 20 and prepend it to the string, giving us `718507355this_is_a_bitcoin_block`. The new string hashes to `0436786C81ABE313C104D821BE4EE96D3A88C3A3B93C54C8BBED9C6EE25DB8D3`, thus solving the puzzle for `k = 1`. Subsequently, a value of 457 for the nonce solves the puzzle for `k = 2` since `457this_is_a_bitcoin_block` hashes to `004306ef8f43e38fb17bce7cb96e568ed904e334dafb3cd69568a27ac564e08c`.  

Your mission (and yes, you have to accept it) is to run **project_1** with Spark to determine the nonce for varying difficulties of `k` with one of the following strings:
```
// If you're working in a group of three
this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_yourEagleId1_and_yourEagleId2_and_yourEagleId3

// If you're working in a pair
this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_yourEagleId1_and_yourEagleId2

// If you're working alone
this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_yourEagleId
```

The program accepts three parameters: the header string `S`, the difficulty `k`, and the number of trials `n`. For each trial, it will generate a random number between 1 and 2<sup>32</sup>-1 for the nonce `x` and hash `xS`. The program distributes the `n` trials evenly among the compute nodes and executes them in parallel. If a valid nonce is found for difficulty `k`, `xS` as well as its hash value will be outputted.  

Pass in the arguments by appending them to the `spark-submit` command you ran earlier. For example:
```
// Linux
spark-submit --class project_1.main --master local[*] target/scala-2.12/project_1_2.12-1.0.jar this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_12345678 2 100

// Unix
spark-submit --class "project_1.main" --master "local[*]" target/scala-2.12/project_1_2.12-1.0.jar this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_12345678 2 100
```
In GCP, simply include the arguments in the **Arguments** field of the job you're submitting.  

## Reporting your findings
You'll be submitting a report along with your code that provides commentary on the tasks below.  

1. **(4 points)** Run the program on your local machine to solve cases `k = 2,3,4,5,6`. For each `k`, provide `xS`, its hash value, the total time elapsed, and the number of trials.  
2. **(3 points)** Run the program on GCP to solve the case `k = 7`. Provide `xS`, its hash value, the total time elapsed, and the number of trials. Describe your cluster's configuration (number of machines, number/type of cores, etc.) and your process for estimating the number of trials needed in order to find the nonce.  
3. **(3 points)** Modify **one** line of code in **src/main/scala/project_1/main.scala** so that the program generates the potential nonce from 1 to `n` (the number of trials) instead of randomly. Discuss whether or not this is more efficient than the randomized approach.

## Submission via GitHub
Delete your project's current **README.md** file (the one you're reading right now) and include your report as a new **README.md** file in the project root directory.

### Q1: Run the program on your local machine to solve cases k = 2,3,4,5,6. For each k, provide xS, its hash value, the total time elapsed, and the number of trials.

**Hash String Used:** `this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_35641890_and_45459077`

#### Commentary
Toward the earlier, smaller values of k, we were able to solve the cases using the example command (k=2, n=100) and gradually incrementing the number of trials in multiples of 100 (k=3, n=600). Every case with their corresponding number of trials are tested on our two machines with at least three times of success respectively. However, starting from k=4, the required number of trials increased significantly. Finally, for k=6, we used 4,000,000 trials and observed an increase in computation time. This is because the difficulty of finding a qualified hashed number from the SHA-256 hash family increases exponentially as k goes larger.

### Q2:

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Number of machines: **2**
- Machine type: **n2-standard-4**

**Results for k=7:**
- **xS:** `679105772this_is_a_bitcoin_block_of_45459077_and_35641890`
- **Hash Value:** `00000003dfd79803a7b5d6ea1174db10b8e2b89ef402dc316d3e2dab5d19d05f`
- **Time Elapsed:** **803s**
- **Number of Trials:** **268,435,456 (2^28)**

#### Commentary
To estimate the required number of trials for k=7, we explored on the nature of SHA-256 hashing. 
Each hexadecimal digit in an SHA-256 hash represents 4 bits and has a \( \frac{1}{16} \) probability of being zero. Since the first \( k \) hex digits must all be zero, the probability of this occurring is:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^k = \frac{1}{2^{4k}}
\]

This means that, on average, \( 2^{4k} \) trials are required to find a valid nonce.
The GCP cluster allowed us to handle this computation efficiently within **803 seconds**.

### Q3: Code Modification and Efficiency Analysis

**Original:**
```scala
val nonce = sc.range(0, trials).mapPartitionsWithIndex((indx, iter) => {
  val rand = new scala.util.Random(indx + seed)
  iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(Int.MaxValue - 1) + 1)
})
```

**Modified:**
```scala
val nonce = sc.range(1, trials)
  //val rand = new scala.util.Random(indx + seed)
  //iter.map(x => rand.nextInt(Int.MaxValue - 1) + 1)
```
